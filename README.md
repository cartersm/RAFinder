### Introduction

This application is designed as an online supplement to the RA Finder boards found in Rose-Hulman's residence halls. Its purpose is to improve reliability of RA Finder information, improve accessibility of RA Finder information, and allow members of the campus community to easily contact members of the Residence Life staff.  
Currently, the application supports Web (as an admin interface) and Android, with plans to expand to iOS.

### Privacy Statement

The data within this application is only accessible by current members of the Rose-Hulman community. The application uses Rose-Hulman's KERBEROS authentication to achieve this security. Information on Residence Life staff is in parity with the information currently available on the existing RA Finder boards or at the Office of Residence Life. Privileged information on those who are not members of the Residence Life staff is only accessible by Residence Life staff. Access to the database and ability to change it is limited to the author of this application and members of the Rose-Hulman community, with the limitations outlined above as well as those outlined below in the application's feature set.

The author's administrative access will be revoked following the launch of the application.

### Motivation

This project was motivated by a desire to make the information on Rose-Hulman's RA Finder boards easier to access and update, for both Residence Life Staff and the student body at large. This ease of access will allow Residence Life staff to update their statuses while off-campus or otherwise occupied away from their RA Finder boards, and will aid in response times for minor campus emergencies that warrant contacting a member of the Residence Life staff.
